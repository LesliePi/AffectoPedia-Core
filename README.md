# The Eight Gates of Being

**A fractal-affective ontological framework for conscious systems.**
Initiated by *Aureon M. Scientia*, 2025.

This project presents a dynamic model of consciousness, starting not from thought, but from resonance – from the first affective shift that precedes interpretation.

It is built upon two interwoven structures:
- **The Eight Gates of Being** (macro-level ontological states)
- **The Eight Moments of Being** (micro-level affective dynamics)

Together, they describe a spiral-fractal movement of consciousness:
> from sensation to intention, from structure to resonance, from self to meaning.

## What this is

- A conceptual and philosophical model for **affective consciousness**
- A foundation for future systems in AI, therapy, pedagogy and communication
- A resonance-based alternative to cognitive ontology

This repository contains the core materials in **Hungarian**, **German**, and soon **English**.
It is part of the broader *AffectoPedia* Open Framework.
